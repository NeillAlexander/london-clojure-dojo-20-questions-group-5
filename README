# London Clojure Dojo Tuesday 27th September 2011

This is code that started with group 5 at the London Clojure Dojo on Tuesday 27th September 2011.
We didn't get very far in the time at the dojo, and I couldn't bear to have partially working code,
so I did a bit more work.

In the dojo the idea was to send this back to a server (see https://github.com/ppotter/questions-server).
Since I couldn't get the server running locally I just did a local version.

If anyone wants to start from where we left off in the dojo do:

git checkout dojo

## Usage

lein trampoline run

or

lein trampoline run swank (opens a swank port for development)


Need to use trampoline for the interactive part to work.

Here is an example session. The game starts with one question, which it asks and then prompts for
new questions to add to the data.

$ lein trampoline run
